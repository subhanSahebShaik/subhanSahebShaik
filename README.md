## My Works

1. [Deep Fake Detection Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/subhanSahebShaik/detectify)

Detectify is a deep learning system that detects AI-generated fake videos (deepfakes) using CNN and LSTM-based RNNs. Trained on datasets like Face-Forensic++, Deepfake Detection Challenge, and Celeb-DF, Detectify offers real-time video manipulation detection to combat misinformation and misuse of deepfake technology.

2. [Phishing URL Classififer Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/subhanSahebShaik/facultyvault)
